### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, call me Titanite.
👀 I’m interested in architecture, literature, art and natural sciences
❤️ I love Minecraft C++ edition :P, Film Scores, gritty Sci-Fiction (especially Jules Verne), and Leon Alberti's Work.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to proficiently draw and express in a manner acceptable to professional standards.
💞️ I’m looking for my dwindling sanity.
