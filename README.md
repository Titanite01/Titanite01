### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, call me Titanite.
👀 I’m interested in architecture, literature, art and natural sciences
❤️ I love Minecraft C++ edition :P, Film Scores, gritty Sci-Fiction (especially Jules Verne), and Leon Alberti's Work.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to proficiently draw and express in a manner acceptable to professional standards.
💞️ I’m looking for suggestions and discussion on Baolei and the I-Ching, though I'd be down to talk about art and culture anytime.

P.S. I'm a vexatious professed iconoclast, so if you have any dogmatic and dainty notions, keep them far away, I'm going to break them, sooner or later, with intent or not, :)
