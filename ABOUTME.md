- 👋 Hi, I’m ####, a ########## at #########.
- 👀 I’m interested in architecture, literature and natural sciences
- ❤️ I love Minecraft C++ edition :P, Film Scores, gritty Sci-Fiction (especially Jules Verne), and Leon Alberti's Work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to proficiently draw and express in a manner acceptable to professional standards.
- 💞️ I’m looking for suggestions and discussion on Baolei and the I-Ching, though I'd be down to talk about art and culture anytime.
